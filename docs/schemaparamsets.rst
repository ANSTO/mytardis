Schema and Parameter Sets
=========================

MyTARDIS stores metadata as *Parameters*, which are grouped in to *Parameter Sets*, which are defined by a *Schema*.

===============
Managing Schema
===============

MyTARDIS currently relies on the in-built Django administrative interface for managing schema.  The administrative interface is accesible from a link similar to::

   http://localhost/admin/



Note: Creating a proper schema administration page is scheduled to be completed by December 2011.
